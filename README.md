# File-Compression-program
Program is using run length encoding as compression algorithm.
It reads text from Input.txt file and then creates compressed.txt file where it stores compressed text. Compression is implemented only if compressed file is smaller than the original one.
Decomression program reads text from compressed.txt and creates decompressed.txt file where it stores decompressed text. Program was tested on various examples and no information loss or distortion been seen.
